DashboardNow is an AI Dashboard that lets users chat to GPT 3.5 Turbo, have code generated by it, generate images using DALL-E 3 and generate music and videos from models found on Replicate. The application was built using specifications from the hiring challenge presented by AI company Ada Nomad. Next.js was used along with REACT.js, express. axios and CORS. MUI was used for graphical components where necessary.
